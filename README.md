# Simple Slider (💩 Slider)

## Why ? 😕
Why not ? I like to hack my tools.

## Features 🍻
- Minimalist and no over-bloated.
- Code highlight.
- Math support.
- Vi keymaps.

## How use 📚
First clone the repo, and thats all, just edit the `index.html` file with your content.

in the `src/` dir are the css and js file, change everything as you want.
